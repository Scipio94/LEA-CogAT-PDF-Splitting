# PDF Splitting
Python script to split PDFs by page and label the output based on the primary key found on the PDF file

## Packages
I used two packages in the script, one to extract text from the PDF and another to split the PDF:

1. [tabula-py](https://pypi.org/project/tabula-py/) - used to extract text from each page of the PDF
2. [pypdf](https://pypi.org/project/pypdf/) - used to split the pdf by page, label, and write create PDF files
